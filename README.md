# Build an Interactive Form
### Treehouse Techdegree Project #3 - Build an Interactive Form

In this project, you'll create an interactive registration form for "FullStack Conf." Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll use JavaScript to enhance the form by adding interactivity. You’ll also make the form more user-friendly by providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. You can use plain JavaScript or jQuery –– it's up to you!

This project is a great way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. It also gives you a simple interactive portfolio project you can use to show off your understanding of JavaScript. Forms are a large part of any web application, so learning how to make them easy-to-use, interactive and responsive is a task worth mastering.


# Project Requirements

### Focus on the first field
- [x] On page load, the cursor appears in the "Name" field, ready for a user to type.
### Job Role Section
- [x] "Your job role" text field appears when user selects "Other" from the Job Role menu
### T-Shirt Section
- [x] No color options appear in the “Color” menu until the user chooses a T-Shirt theme. The “Color” menu reads “Please select a T-shirt theme” until a theme is selected from the “Design” menu.
- [x] T-shirt color options are revealed based on the design selected.
- [x] “Color” drop down menu is hidden until a T-Shirt design is selected.
### Activity Registration
- [x] User cannot select two activities that are at the same time
- [x] Total cost of selected activities is calculated and displayed below the list of activities
### Displaying payment sections
- [x] When a user chooses a payment option, the chosen payment section is revealed and the other payment sections are hidden
### Form Validation
- [x] Form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the following requirements have been met:
- [x] Name field isn’t blank
- [x] Email field contains validly formatted e-mail address: (doesn’t have to check that it's a real e-mail address, just that it's formatted like one: dave@teamtreehouse.com, for example).
- [x] At least one checkbox under "Register for Activities" section must be selected.
- [x] If "Credit Card" is the selected payment option, the three fields accept only numbers: a 13 to 16-digit credit card number, a 5-digit zip code, and 3-number CVV value
- [x] Form provides at least one error message that changes depending on the error. For example, the email field displays a different error message when the email field is empty than it does when the email address is formatted incorrectly. This is accomplished without the use of HTML5's built-in field validation.
### Form Validation Messages
- [x] On submission, the form provides an error indication or message for each field that requires validation: name field, email field, “Register for Activities” checkboxes, credit card number, zip code, and CVV
user has entered a complete and correctly formatted email address
### Form Works Without JavaScript
- [x] When JavaScript is disabled, all form fields and payment information is displayed, including the "Other" field in the "Job Role" menu

# Appraiser Comments
Great work! Forms are everywhere on the web, so as web developers it's our job to make the experience of filling them out as pleasant as possible. You've really succeeded here, so very well done!

Now that you’ve passed project 3 with flying colors, you’re eligible to do project reviews! This is an opportunity to test and grade Techdegree projects built by fellow students. Code reviewing is often a big part of a developer’s job, so project reviewing is a great chance to get some practice reading other people’s code, figure out how it works, and give professional feedback. You’ll be able to expand your skills as a developer by seeing a variety of different ways to solve a coding problem.

Go ahead and give it a try! You’ll find the link to a short training video along with a list of available projects in the new “Peer Review” tab on your Techdegree homepage.
